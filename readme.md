Just some covers for games, optimised for Heroic's cropping. (they crop a small bit of the top and bottom)
Some of them are originally from SteamGridDB, such as fnf, which I edited to fit Heroic better.

Some notes:
- [krp-vr](krp-vr.png) is Kart Racing Pro's VR mode, with a generic VR icon poorly attached to the driver's helmet from the regular cover art.
- [cloudfall](cloudfall.png) and [overhead](overhead.png) are from my classwork. Overhead is available on my [itch.io](https://cubeegames.itch.io) page.
- [ncr](ncr.png) is for Ninja Cat Remewstered.
- [njap](njap.png) is for Abandoned Pub from the Neuro-Sama Game Jam (njap = Neuro Jam Abandoned Pub). I edited the cover so it doesn't look as cropped.
- [unhando](unhando.png) had a lot of effort put into making it look nice. it's also from the Neuro-Sama Game Jam and is quite fun to play.
- [overte](overte.png) is an open source social vr platform. haven't messed with it too much, but it seems interesting.
- [i-am-steve](i-am-steve.png) for some reason has semi-decent assets on its itch.io page. hmmmmmm.
- Non-game programs:
  - [utau](utau.png) works if you set the environment variables right, something like setting `LC_ALL` and `LANG` both to `ja_JP.UTF-8`. but at this point it's probably better to use [openutau](openutau.png).
  - [vnyan](vnyan.png) is for the vtubing software of the same name. nothing special.
  - [moat](moat.png) is for the Museum of All Things, an OpenXR-based wikipedia experience.

I would put these on SteamGridDB but I need to request games to be added for a lot of these, which I can't be bothered doing and they probably wouldn't get added based on the requirements anyway, so think of this as my personal GridDB.
