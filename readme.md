Just some covers for games, optimised for Heroic's cropping. (bits of the top and bottom like to get cut off)
Some of them are originally from SteamGridDB, such as fnf, which I edited to fit Heroic better.

Some notes:
- [cloudfall] and [overhead] are from my classwork.
- [njap] is Abandoned Pub from the Neuro Game Jam. (Neuro Jam Abandoned Pub)
- [unhando] had a lot of effort put into making it look nice. it's also from the Neuro Game Jam.
- [utau] works if you set the environment variables right, something like setting `LC_ALL` and `LANG` both to `ja_JP.UTF-8`. but at this point just use [openutau].

I would put these on SteamGridDB but I need to request games to be added for a lot of these, which I can't be bothered doing and they probably wouldn't get added based on the requirements anyway.
