Just some covers for games, optimised for Heroic's cropping. (they crop a small bit of the top and bottom)
Some of them are originally from SteamGridDB, such as fnf, which I edited to fit Heroic better.

Notable entries follow.

### My projects

- [ncr](ncr.png) is for [Ninja Cat Remewstered](https://pixelshock.itch.io/ninja-cat-remewstered).
- [cloudfall](cloudfall.png) is for Cloudfall. It is currently unreleased, however there is a [VRChat world]() that replicates the environment with no funcitonality.
- [overhead](overhead.png) is available on my [itch.io page](https://cubeegames.itch.io/overhead).
- [whimsy](whimsy.png) is available [here on itch.io](https://peopleofwhimsy.itch.io/whimsy).

### Other games

- [krp-vr](krp-vr.png) is Kart Racing Pro's VR mode, with a generic VR icon poorly attached to the driver's helmet from the regular cover art.
- [njap](njap.png) is for Abandoned Pub from the Neuro-Sama Game Jam (njap = Neuro Jam Abandoned Pub). I edited the cover so it doesn't look as cropped.
- [unhando](unhando.png) had a lot of effort put into making it look nice. it's also from the Neuro-Sama Game Jam and is quite fun to play.
- [overte](overte.png) is an open source social vr platform. haven't messed with it too much, but it seems interesting.
- [i-am-steve](i-am-steve.png) for some reason has semi-decent assets on its itch.io page. hmmmmmm.

### Non-game programs

- [utau](utau.png) works if you set the environment variables right, something like setting `LC_ALL` and `LANG` both to `ja_JP.UTF-8`. but at this point it's probably better to use [openutau](openutau.png).
- [vnyan](vnyan.png) is for the vtubing software of the same name. nothing special.
- [moat](moat.png) is for the Museum of All Things, an OpenXR-based wikipedia experience.
